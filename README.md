# FAL-ANN
Fuzzy ART Layered Adaptive Neural Network benchsuit for the minefield navigation problem

This repository contains the Fuzzy ART Layered Adaptive Neural Network. It is a proposal from my Thesis mainly focusing to deploy a categorization mechanism better than the one provided by the Adaptive Ressonance Associative Map. The proposal was inspired on a layered architectecture. 

It is faster, more stable, categorizes better than the ARAM model. Moreover, its behavior suggests that it is much more reliable to deploy reinforcement learning methods in real-time than deep learning approaches, due to its lightweight architecture and also to the fact that it does not depend on a GPU to perform. Making it an excelent solution to be used for digital games and applications where the learning and executions times are important and resources are limited.

The provided code is under development of an ungoing research, and is under the MiT license. Any attempt of plagiarism will be treated legally.

The provided code deploy the FAL-ANN, as a replication of the minefield navigation simulator and the ARAM model with a FALCON architecture. A further tutorial, on how to use the code, will be added as soon as possible.
